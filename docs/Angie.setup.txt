I have decided to convert Index.cshtml into Angular2 SPA. So I have "installed" TypeScript angular2 typings in ~/Views/Home:
	(as a prerequisite, I installed node.js and/or npm somehow, then tsd as a global thing: npm install -g tsd@^0.6.0)
	Also, VisualStudio has the latest TypeScript plugin; get it from "current" linke here: http://www.typescriptlang.org/
	tsd install angular2 es6-promise rx rx-lite

Next step is to follow these tutorials to get Angular2 to work, then start converting Ci=ontacts and About into Angular2 compoents:
	https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/quickstart.html

So I have decided to consider "Views" the root of my "root" SPA, and to add sub-spa-s under each of Views 9functionally-defined) subfolders. So I added the "root" app.ts in Views and that needed two adjustments to work:
1. I had to add this "hint": /// <reference path="typings/angular2/angular2.d.ts"/> for the import to work.
2. I also had to follow these directions to edit the project file to allow eperimental decorators: http://bchavez.bitarmory.com/archive/2015/07/23/enabling-decorators-support-in-typescript-1-5-visual-studio-2015.aspx
At this point my little app.ts from here worked (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html) - I took the version for TS "Angular2 for TypeScript" selection in the dropdown
	
Throw-away references (for after I'm done):
	This guy has a working ANgular2 in VSS with Type Script, but almost no info on setup: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2015-Final-Release-Event/TypeScript-and-Angular-2-in-Visual-Studio-2015

	This is a nice boiler-plate setup - use it to see how they're doing Jasmine with Karma; check out the protractor thing, too: https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter

	This is a great reference to get started with Angular2 straight from the source. It includes full stack (not VS-friendly) - Angular + typings + a bunch of other shit: https://libraries.io/npm/angular2/2.0.0-alpha.35
	Note: that's a good source to see what is latest Angular2
	
	Is angular ready? :-) http://splintercode.github.io/is-angular-2-ready/

	SPA with Angular - GOOD resource on setting up various aspects of MVC and WebAPI to support the SPA paradigm: http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/build-a-single-page-application-(spa)-with-aspnet-web-api-and-angularjs
